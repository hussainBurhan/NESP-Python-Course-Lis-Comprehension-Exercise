# List Comprehension Exercise
This Python program demonstrates various ways to manipulate lists using list comprehensions. It includes examples of filtering sublists based on the presence of the letter 'G'.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (list_comprehension_examples.py).
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter
5. The program will execute and display the output, showing the modified lists.
### Example Output
[['A', 'B', 'C'], ['D', 'E', 'F'], 'Letter was skipped']
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[['A', 'B', 'C'], ['D', 'E', 'F']]
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[['A', 'B', 'C'], ['D', 'E', 'F'], 'Letter was skipped']
